## Installation

### XAMPP
In our project we are using XAMPP (Apache, MariaDb, Php, Perl) with X meaning that it works on any platform.
For example, LAMP only works on Linux while WAMP only works on Windows.

Here's the link to download XAMPP : 
â€¢ https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

## Prepare environnement

### XAMPP Modules
For the project to work, you must enable the **Apache** and **MySql** modules.

### XAMPP htdocs files
When using XAMPP, we'll need to transfer all necessary files to htdocs/ in the XAMPP folder. Copy the cloned folder and put it inside the **htdocs/"chooseNameFolder"** folder inside the installation folder for XAMPP. 

Personnally, I have created a new folder inside htdocs/ where I have put all the necessary files.

### XAMPP Port 3306 MySql
Be cautious, if you have anything else running on the 3306 socket, like WAMP or a MySql command line client, XAMPP's MySql will
not work.

### Send email
Once the user has created their account, a verification email will be sent. However, for that to work, XAMPP must be properly configured beforehands.

**(1)** Generate an App Password
- Go to your Google Account settings.
- Navigate to the **Security** tab.
- Under the **How you sign in to Google**, click on **2-Step Verification**.
- At the bottom, click on **App passwords**, and create an app. Google will give you a password for that app.

**(2)** Configure XAMPP
- Open the **php.ini** file inside **XAMPP\php\php.ini**
- Update the following settings
```
SMTP=smtp.gmail.com
smpt_port=587
sendmail_from = your-email@gmail.com
sendmail_path = "\"C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe\" -t"
```
- **NOTES**
- your-email@gmail is referencing the gmail account email addrress where you have created the app password.
- sendmail_path = ..., this is a default installation folder, if you have installed your XAMPP somewhere else, the path must be modified.


**(3)** Configure Sendmail
- Open the **sendmail.ini** file inside **XAMPP\sendmail\sendmail.ini**
- Update the following settings
```
smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com
smpt_port=587
sendmail_from = 
auth_username=your-email@gmail.com
auth_password=your-app-password
```

- **NOTES**
- your-email@gmail is referencing the gmail account email addrress where you have created the app password.
- auth_password=your-app-password, this is where you'll put the given password by Google when you created the app. If you don't have anymore, you can just create another one.

**(3)** Restart Apache
- Restart Apache server for the effects to be taken into account.
